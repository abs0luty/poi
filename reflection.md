# Reflection

Several trade‑offs guided this implementation. First, I chose an in‑memory registry (Python dicts and dataclasses) for simplicity and speed of iteration. The assignment does not require persistence beyond a configuration loader, so avoiding a database reduced complexity and made test‑driven development straightforward. If scaled to much larger datasets, swapping in a persistent store and indexes would be advisable; for now, memory is adequate.

For closest pair, I used the straightforward O(n²) search instead of a plane‑sweep or divide‑and‑conquer approach. Given typical class‑assignment scales, this keeps the code clear and deterministic without premature optimization. A future enhancement could introduce spatial indexing (e.g., k‑d tree) once the problem size justifies it.

Handling floating‑point boundaries is subtle. I standardized on ε = 1e−6 and wrapped comparisons (≤ and equality) in helpers to prevent exclusion or duplication on the boundary. This aligns with the brief's emphasis on robust boundary correctness and keeps numerical concerns localized. Picking the ε is necessarily heuristic; 1e−6 comfortably exceeds binary rounding noise for small integer coordinates yet is small relative to typical distances.

The type deletion constraint and ID non‑reuse were modeled explicitly: a set tracks all used POI IDs (even after deletion), and type deletion validates that no POIs of that type remain. These choices enforce the invariants at the data layer, reducing the chance that later features violate them.

For counting semantics, the brief's default of distinct (unique visitors per POI, unique POIs per visitor) is implemented using sets before aggregation. This avoids subtle bugs where repeat visits inflate counts. At the same time, visit events are stored with dates and optional ratings, enabling future queries that do need multiplicity.

I implemented the optional rename extensions because they exercise schema evolution. Attribute rename migrates every POI in that type; if a POI lacks the old attribute, a None is created for the new field - an explicit, debuggable policy. Type rename rewrites references inside the registry for consistency. Both operations are guarded by validation and tested.

Finally, I emphasized deterministic ordering (tie‑breaks by ID, then name) so outputs are stable across runs and easy to test. Overall, the design prioritizes correctness, clarity, and testability over micro‑optimizations - appropriate for the assignment's goals and evaluation criteria.
